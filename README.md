## Overview
The dataset is derived from the 2020 annual CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which includes over 300,000 adult records, making it one of the largest and most comprehensive surveys on health behaviors in the United States. It focuses on key indicators that are associated with heart disease, such as Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking habits, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep duration and chronic health conditions like diabetes and asthma.

This dataset not only highlights individual-level health metrics but also provides valuable demographic details such as age, sex, race and general health status, enabling in-depth analysis of heart disease trends across diverse population groups. Its scale and coverage allow for regional comparisons, which can be useful for identifying geographic patterns of heart disease prevalence and guiding localized intervention strategies.
